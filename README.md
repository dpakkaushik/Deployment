The technique of estimating future sales and revenues is called sales forecasting. Accurate sales predictions help businesses plan their operations and forecast both short- and long-term performance. Businesses can use historical sales data, comparisons across industries, and macroeconomic trends to forecast estimates. Experienced businesses are better able to predict future sales since they have access to years' worth of historical company data. In order to predict their future business, newly established businesses must rely on less reliable data, such as market research and competitor data. With the help of sales forecasting, a company's staff, cash flow, and resources may be managed. Therefore, it can be said that a sales forecast is a highly helpful strategy for any firm, as it aids in the timely management of an organization's workforce, cash flow, and resources.
